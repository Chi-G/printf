0x11. C - printf team project

Group Project: Collaborating with Chinemere Chukwudalu

0. Write a function that produces output according to a format.
1. Write a function that Handle the following conversion specifiers:
 d
 i
 You don’t have to handle the flag characters
 You don’t have to handle field width
 You don’t have to handle precision
 You don’t have to handle the length modifiers

2. Write a function that Handle the following custom conversion specifiers: b: the unsigned int argument is converted to binary
3. Write a function that Handle the following conversion specifiers:
 u
 o
 x
 X
 You don’t have to handle the flag characters
 You don’t have to handle field width
 You don’t have to handle precision
 You don’t have to handle the length modifiers

4. Write a function that Use a local buffer of 1024 chars in order to call write as little as possible.
5. Write a function that Handle the following custom conversion specifier:
 S : prints the string.
 Non printable characters (0 < ASCII value < 32 or >= 127) are printed this way: \x, followed by the ASCII code value in hexadecimal (upper case - always 2 characters)

6. Write a function that Handle the following conversion specifier: p.
 You don’t have to handle the flag characters
 You don’t have to handle field width
 You don’t have to handle precision
 You don’t have to handle the length modifiers

7. Write a function that Handle the following flag characters for non-custom conversion specifiers: +, space,  #

8. Write a function that Handle the following length modifiers for non-custom conversion specifiers: l, h 

 Conversion specifiers to handle: d, i, u, o, x, X

9. Write a function that Handle the field width for non-custom conversion specifiers.
10. Write a function that Handle the precision for non-custom conversion specifiers.
11. Write a function that Handle the 0 flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.
12. Write a function that Handle the - flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.
13. Write a function that Handle the following custom conversion specifier:
 r : prints the reversed string

14. Write a function that Handle the following custom conversion specifier:
 R: prints the rot13'ed string

15. All the above options work well together.
